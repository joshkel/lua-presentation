Slides and notes from a presentation I did on Lua for the [Knoxville Coding Dojo](http://www.meetup.com/Knoxville-Coding-Dojo/).

To view locally:

1. Install node, npm, and bower, if you haven't already done so.
2. Run `bower install` to install [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).
3. Run a local web server to view the content. (If you have Python 3 installed, then `python -m http.server` works well.)
